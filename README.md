Sugar Cane Macro
First you need a text editor, I use PyCharm and Visual Studio code, you will need to download the latest python interpreter and add the pyautogui module which is the main element in making this code work. Screenshots will be provided on how to setup your farm below and a video on how to add this module to PyCharm.  First you will need 2 plots for this code, and you will need to add 1 slab every 2 rows on each side of the farm as shown below. Step 2, buy all the plots behind the and in front of your farms and add a barricade as shown below.. Does not have to be neat as you can see and do not worry about the barn as you do need a barricade for that as you do not back into it as it  is  a forward farming row.  Step 3, reverting back to Row #1. You will need to build a 1 block wide hole as I show below and make a 1 block tall wall that stretches all the way back to row 1, next you have to make a small walk way to make sure you don't go into another row. After that you should be done. I made this code because I didn't feel like doing farming until I wanted to kill myself and all the macros I see are downloads which are probably going to screw my computer or get me hacked so I made this code. Enjoy :)
